# Epignosi 100

**“Epignosi 100”** is a digital game–ritual that invites the player into a practice of observation and mindfulness.

It begins with a countdown from **100 to 0** — a symbolic choice.

In many contemplative traditions, 100 is a sacred number:
- the number of beads on a mala used for repetition and concentration,  
- the number of earthly desires in Buddhist philosophy,  
- the number that links body, breath, and cosmos in yogic thought.

By starting from 100, the game introduces a ceremonial rhythm — one that encourages inner focus.

## How to Play

A sequence of numbers appears, one at a time, counting down from **100 to 0**.

- Every time the **last digit** of a number contains **1** or **6** (e.g., 91, 86, 61), the player must **click**.  
- If the player **misses** such a number or **clicks at the wrong time**, negative points are silently recorded.  
- If the player notices that a **number was skipped** (i.e., it did not appear during the countdown), they must also **click** — as a mindful acknowledgment of absence.  
- At any time, the player may **double-click to restart** — a gesture of awareness, not punishment.  

> The goal is not precision — it is **awareness**.

## Beyond the Game

**“Epignosi 100”** is an artwork that reflects on the nature of **attention**.

Its simple structure becomes a mirror:

> Where is your focus?  
> When is your action conscious, and when is it automatic?  
> Can you recognize a lapse — and gently begin again?

By reducing gameplay to a single action — watching and clicking — the work opens up space for **introspection and stillness in motion**.

## Structure & Symbolism

- The countdown is a **metaphor for impermanence**.  
- The number **100** acts as a subtle entry into **ritual and reflection**.  
- The option to **restart** is always present — not as failure, but as **choice**.

**Only your awareness.**

**The goal: reach zero without losing contact with the present moment.**
